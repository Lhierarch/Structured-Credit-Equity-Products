# Structured-Credit-Equity-Products
This is the Course project of BUSI97139-Structured Credit &amp; Equity Products. Supervisor: Moritz Duembgen and Davide Silvestrini. Working from JP Morgan
In this project, I computed related Credit Default Swaps, indices and options; equity dividend swaps and variance swaps as well as credit correlation products. They both calculated under VBA in excel, with the instruction documents from JP Morgan CDS part.
Please refer to "Final Project.pdf" for full description.
