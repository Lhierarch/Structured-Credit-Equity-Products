# Structured-Credit-Equity-Products
This is the Course project of BUSI97139-Structured Credit &amp; Equity Products. Supervisor: Dr. Jeffery Hurley In this project, I developed a 3D simulation of a UAV show over a football field, using OpenGL and MPI. Specifically, I used 16 threads to control each UAV respectively, which are capable of real-time communication with each other. Please refer to "Final Project.pdf" for full description.
